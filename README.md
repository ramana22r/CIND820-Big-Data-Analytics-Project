Overview: National Basketball Association, more commonly known as the NBA, is the organization that organizes professional basketball in the United States. With 30 teams and over 500 players part of the league, there is one iconic player who has impacted the game since he entered, LeBron James.

Scope of Project: This project will be analyzing LeBron James’, past seasons’ team and individual statistics (2003-2020) with the goal of predicting his performance for the 2020-2021 season. This will be calculated using an ARIMA time series forecast of the game score statistic that is used to provide an overall perspective of a player’s statistical performance and productivity throughout an entire basketball game.

Dataset: The dataset for the individual career statistics was obtained through Maven Analytics, while the team statistics dataset was appended through Basketball Reference. The dataset used for the project is named "lebron_career.csv". The code is in ipynb format, titled "Initial Resuts.ipynb".
